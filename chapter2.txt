Fire raged upon the cathedral. There was no way for Gillian to reach the top. 

Ethan thought that there was no hope, his hands hung helpless by his side as he was stranded a mile away from the cathedral by a 10 foot tall barricade.   

A flying (flying?) ship (he could not find the words to describe it), swooped low and sent a blast of fire beam at the barricade. He staggered from the rumbling earth as the barricade crumbled in front of him.
